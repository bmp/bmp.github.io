  	      It has been an exceedingly joyous journey with brilliant people who have worked with us over the past eleven years. FoV was an experiment to create tools and methods that are relevant to India, but today, we are humbled that these tools are relevant across the world. (2/n)

  	      When we started, it was amusing (at best) to think of using #games and #simulations to address the hard problems in #publicpolicy. We were repeatedly asked if we should stop using ‘wicked problems’ as most people don’t understand it. (3/n)
